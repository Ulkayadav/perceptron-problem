# perceptron-problem
The Perceptron is a fundamental machine learning algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. This project demonstrates how the Perceptron learns from labeled data to classify input into one of two categories.
# Algorithm
The Perceptron works as follows:

i) Initialize weights and bias to zero or small random values.

ii) For a number of epochs:

   . For each training sample:

       .Predict the output.

       .Update the weights and bias if the prediction is incorrect.
